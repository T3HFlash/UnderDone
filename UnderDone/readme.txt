UnderDone - Simple Module-Based RPG Gamemode by Polkim / Flash
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a community project in a attemp to fix up UnderDone and add new content such as items , quests , and other such projects. Thank you for viewing our .github page your all welcome to commit your quests to our Quest Suggestions Wiki Page edit it and place your ideas and we will get on it and commit it to the gamemode. UnderDone was a project org. by Polkim as a attemp at a fun GLua RPG gamemode which was free. He released it in the middle of the year in late August and left the project after finishing the Core GLua code. Soon after this we began to try and keep the code maintained but no one had a central database to commit there fixes and changes to the script so Flash decided to start a .github account and make that central database. Anyway thank you all for checking out and downloading our script ! Also thank you developers for taking your time to commit your custom items and fixes.
